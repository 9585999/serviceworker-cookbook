<p>This demo allows you to experiment with the quota management rules enforced by browsers.

The browser will likely reduce the quota assigned to you if you send too many notifications not visible to the user.
Try closing this page after selecting one of the two options ("visible" or "invisible") with a high number of notifications.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you selected visible notifications, you will see them appear one after another on your screen. The quota will not be enforced;</li>
  <li>If you selected invisible notifications, you will see logs in the browser console, but they will stop once reaching the quota.</li>
</ul>

<form>
Number of notifications to send: <input id='notification-num' type='number' value='50'></input>
</form>

<button id="visible">Visible notifications</button>
<button id="invisible">Invisible notifications</button>
