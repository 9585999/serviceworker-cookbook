# Cache from ZIP

## Use case
As a web developer I want to distribute my applications as individual packages reducing this way the number of HTTP requests and providing an implicit way of listing all the resources to offline.

## Solution
While installing the SW, download the zipfile and decompress, caching each of resources.
